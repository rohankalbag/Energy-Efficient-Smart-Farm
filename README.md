# Energy-Efficient-Smart-Farm

Course Project done in Department Introductory Course EN 110 - Spring Semester 2020

## **Course Instructor - Prof S.B Kedare**

### Group Project by Rohan Rajesh Kalbag, Sahil P Nair, Atharva Waghmare and Shruti Prajapati

- Selected the pumps, sprinklers for the irrigation system

- Ideated the design of an automated, Solar PV powered energy efficient smart irrigation system for a hypothetical farm

- Designed the blueprints and schematics of an Arduino Mega microcontroller board driven driven control
system using Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensing.

- Implemented the request scheduling of turning on/off of sprinklers using a Queue data structure implemented using C++.

- The code for the above two points can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/rohankalbag/Energy-Efficient-Smart-Farm/blob/main/EN%20Course%20Project%20Arduino%20Sketch.ino">here</a>

- Designed an on-grid solar PV setup to sustain the energy needs of the farm and also serve as another source of revenue.

- Estimated the capital investment, economics and simple payback period of the project.
